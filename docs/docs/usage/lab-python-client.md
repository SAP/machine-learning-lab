# ML Lab Python Client

The python client for ML Lab allows you to connect to any ML Lab instance in order to upload & download files, sync experiments, access ML Lab services, and more. The ML Lab python client is already preinstalled within the research workspace. If you want to use the client outside of the workspace, you can find information on how to install it [here](#TODO). The best way to find out how to use this client library is the [lab client tutorial](#TODO) that is also included in the workspace.

## Client Tutorial

The `lab client tutorial` demonstrates you how to connect to ML Lab and run & manage your experiments within python. We highly recommend to go through this tutorial by yourself. This tutorial is available inside your workspace in the `tutorial` folder.
